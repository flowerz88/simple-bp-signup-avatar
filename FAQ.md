Temporary avatars for unactivated accounts are automatically cleaned up after 7 days.

**Is this plugin compatible with instant registration (without email confirmation or admin approval)?**

**How does the compression feature work?**

The plugin allows administrators to set a compression level (from 0 to 100) for uploaded images. This helps to reduce file sizes while maintaining good image quality. Users can see a real-time, browser-based preview of how their compressed avatar might look during the upload process. Please note the live preview may differ slightly from the final compressed image due to differences in browser rendering and server-side image processing.

The plugin uses standard BuddyPress styling. You can further customize the appearance using custom CSS in your theme or a custom CSS plugin.

**My language is currently not supported. What can I do?**

Simple BuddyPress Signup Avatar is translation-ready and supports any WordPress-compatible translation method. Here are a few options:

1. Use a translation plugin:
   You can use plugins like Loco Translate, WPML, or Polylang to translate the plugin into your language directly within WordPress.

2. Create translation files manually:
   If you're comfortable with translation tools, you can create .po and .mo files for your language and place them in the plugin's '/languages' directory.

3. Contribute your translations:
   We welcome community translations! If you've translated the plugin, you can send us your translation files (.po and .mo) and we'll be happy to include them in the next release. This helps other users who speak your language.

4. Request a translation:
   If you need the plugin in a specific language but can't create the translation yourself, open an issue on our GitHub repository. The community or our team might be able to help.

To contribute or request translations, please visit our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/flowerz88/simple-bp-signup-avatar) and open an issue or pull request.

Remember, the plugin uses the textdomain 'simple-buddypress-signup-avatar' for all its translatable strings.
